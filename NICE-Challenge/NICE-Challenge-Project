### 🧠 Scenario
A vulnerability was discovered within the organization’s **HR and Accounting applications**, which allowed cross-departmental access to sensitive data.  
My objective was to design and enforce access controls preventing unauthorized use of either application by users from the opposite department.

---

### ⚙️ Actions Taken
1. Created and linked a **GPO (DasApp Policy)** at the domain level.  
2. Enabled **Application Identity Service** within the policy.  
3. Configured **AppLocker Executable Enforcement**.  
4. Generated three **Default AppLocker Rules**.  
5. Used AppLocker to:
   - Deny HR users from accessing the Accounting app.  
   - Deny Accounting users from accessing the HR app.

### 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **Windows Server / Active Directory**
- **Group Policy Management Console (GPMC)**

### 📊 Outcome
