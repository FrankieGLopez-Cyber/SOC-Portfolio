## 🧠 Scenario
A security gap was identified where users in the HR and Accounting departments could access each other’s applications, creating a **confidentiality and internal access control risk**.

**Objective:**  
Enforce **role-based application access** to ensure:
- HR users can only run the HR application  
- Accounting users can only run the Accounting application  

---

## ⚙️ Actions Taken
- Created and linked a **domain-level GPO (DasApp Policy)**  
- Enabled the **Application Identity Service** to support AppLocker  
- Configured **AppLocker Executable Rules** to control permitted applications  
- Generated **Default Allowed Rules** to maintain OS stability  
- Implemented **Explicit Deny Rules** to:
  - Block HR users from launching the Accounting app  
  - Block Accounting users from launching the HR app  

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Windows Server / Active Directory  
- Group Policy Management Console (GPMC)  
- AppLocker (Executable Policy Enforcement)  
- Security Policy Editor  
- AD Users, Groups & OU Management  

---

## 📊 Outcome
| Result | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| ✅ | All 8 validation checks passed |
| 🔐 | Department application access successfully isolated |
| 🚫 | Cross-department execution attempts blocked |
| 📏 | System now enforces **Least Privilege & Separation of Duties** |

---

## 🔥 Security Impact
This configuration:
- **Eliminates unauthorized internal data access**
- Protects **sensitive HR and financial information**
- Ensures **policy-based enforcement**, not trust-based access
- Demonstrates **Zero Trust** and **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** principles

Supports compliance frameworks:
- **NIST 800-53 (AC-1, AC-3)**
- **SOX** (Internal Access Governance)
- **HIPAA Privacy Controls**

## 🧩 NICE Framework Alignment

| Category | Code | Demonstrated Capability |
|---------|------|------------------------|
| **Task** | T0123 | Implement system/application cybersecurity controls |
| **Knowledge** | K0060 | Operating system security configuration |
| **Knowledge** | K0049 | Enterprise security boundary/segmentation |
| **Skill** | S0031 | Apply system access control configurations |
| **Skill** | S0147 | Assess effectiveness of applied controls |

---

## 🏁 Summary
This challenge demonstrates the ability to **design and enforce application access controls** using Active Directory and AppLocker to prevent improper internal data access.  
It reflects real-world competencies required in:
- **SOC Analyst**
- **IAM Analyst**
- **Security Administrator**

**Core Strength Demonstrated:** Practical implementation of **Least Privilege** and **Zero Trust** policy enforcement in a Windows enterprise environment.
