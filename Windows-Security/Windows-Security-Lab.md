# ü™ü Windows Security Administration Lab ‚Äì EFS, BitLocker & Updates

**Course:** CIS1950 ‚Äì Windows Client Administration  
**Author:** Frankie Lopez  
**Environment:** Windows 10 VM | PowerShell | Active Directory Tools  

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Objective
Implement and validate Windows data protection controls using **file and disk encryption**, **certificate recovery**, and **system patch management** to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and recoverability.

---

## üß∞ Tasks Completed
- Configured **Encrypting File System (EFS)** to protect user-sensitive files  
- Tested **cross-user access restrictions** to validate permission enforcement  
- Performed **certificate recovery** using a **Recovery Agent** and certificate import  
- Enabled and verified **BitLocker** full-disk encryption with **Recovery Key backup**  
- Confirmed BitLocker status and administration using PowerShell (`Get-Command *BitLocker*`)  
- Managed **Windows Updates** to maintain system integrity and patch compliance  

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Purpose
These configurations enforce:
- **Confidentiality** of stored files and disks
- **Recovery capability** in the event of key loss or device theft
- **System trustworthiness** through ongoing security patch management

This reflects **real enterprise workstation hardening practices**.

## üß† Key Skills Demonstrated
| Skill Category | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| Windows Security Administration | Implemented system-level security controls |
| Encryption & Key Management | Used EFS and BitLocker with recovery strategies |
| Certificate Services | Managed identity-based encryption certificates |
| PowerShell Operations | Verified encryption and system state through CLI |
| Patch Compliance | Ensured system was fully updated and hardened |

## üß© Framework Alignment

**NICE Framework (NIST SP 800-181):**
- **T0123:** Implement cybersecurity controls for systems and applications  
- **T0276:** Apply hardening techniques to reduce attack surface  
- **K0060:** OS-level security configuration and auditing  

**MITRE ATT&CK:**
| Technique | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **T1562.001** | Modify security tools (BitLocker policy & key mgmt) |
| **T1552** | Credentials in files / encryption protection (EFS) |
| **T1078** | Valid accounts and role-based access testing |

---

## üìä Outcome
- **File-level and disk-level encryption fully configured**
- **Recovery keys validated and stored securely**
- **Unauthorized access attempts were blocked**
- **System confirmed patched and current**

‚úÖ **Result:** Secure workstation configuration aligned with enterprise hardening standards.
